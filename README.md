# ProblemSolving_PF
General Path Finding Problems solved like: Multi Agent, A*, obstacle border, possible paths, BFS, DFS
## PROBLEM 1:
* To find the path of a robot that can move only in a grid left,right,up and down BY VARIOUS OBSTACLES LIKE: __Sand,Water,Grass,Rocks,Unwalkable Obstacles__
  * __FIND THE SHORTEST PATH__
  * __FIND THE EASIEST PATH__
  * __FIND THE HARDEST PATH__     
## PROBLEM 2:
* To find the path of a robot that can move only in a grid and in  left, right,up ,down, diagonal directions BY VARIOUS OBSTACLES LIKE: __Sand,Water,Grass,Rocks,Unwalkable Obstacles__
  * __FIND THE SHORTEST PATH__
  * __FIND THE EASIEST PATH__
  * __FIND THE HARDEST PATH__  


## PROBLEM 3
* To find the path to items on the map by avoiding obstacles using multi agent path finding and make the agent closest to the item collect the item and inform the other agents that the item is collected and by which agent.

## PROBLEM 4
* To find all the possible paths to the goal on the map avoiding all the obstacles

## PROBLEM 5
* To detect the border of the obstacles and draw the border of the obstacle
